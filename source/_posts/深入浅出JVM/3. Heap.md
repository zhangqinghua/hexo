## Heap Structs

## Sequence

## Garbage Collector
### What is a 'garbage' instance?
A instance which is never used in the future

### How to find it?
- Reference Counting (引用计数)
    References in a loop -> memory leak
    缺点，循环引用，永远无法回收
- Root Searching (根搜索，正向可达)
    Searching from the root instances. The roots includes JVM Stacks, Native Method Stack, Run-Time Constance Pool, static references In Method Area, Class etc...

## GC Algorithms
### Mark-Sweep (标记清除)
### Copying (拷贝算法)
### Mark-Compact (标记压缩)

## Garbage Collector In HotSpot
### Serial
### Parallel
### Concurrent Mark Sweep
### G1

## Problems
### Why not use References Counting?
### Which instances are roots?
